# Question 3: Tentative Topic

My tentative topic is **Drivers of Attrition: An Application of the MARS Model**.

I plan to use Machine Learning (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict employee turnover by operationalizing McShane & Von Glinow’s **MARS Model** (Motivation, Ability, Role Perceptions, Situational Factors). I will map dataset features to these four pillars to determine which behavioral driver is the strongest predictor of attrition.

# Question 4: Google Document

I have added my topic to the shared document.
